## Introduction:
HATCO (Hair, Anderson, and Tatham company) a large (though nonexistent company) industrial supplier
conducted survey of its customer through an established marketing firm and gathered a dataset. The survey
was focused on attributes identified by HATCO in past which is perceived to be the most influential in
the choice of suppliers.

## Objective:
The main question for this study is what influences the product usage? and to find that we have used
multiple regression analysis to forecast client product consumption based on their opinions of HATCO’s
performance. Also, this model will help HATCO to accurately predict usage level and identifying the most
influential factor in product consumption.

To achieve this objective, we have addressed following problem statements:
1. Consider the overall general Model X9 = X1 X2 X3 X4 X5 X6 X7
2. Perform correlation analysis
3. Fit and analyze the best single independent (simple) regression analysis
4. Fit and analyze stepwise regression analysis to select the best subset model using alpha = 0.05
5. Fit and analyze full model (confirmatory) regression analysis using alpha = 0.05
6. Using the best subset from the stepwise regression analysis now include variable X8 (Firm Size)
and analyze its effect and the new resultant model
7. Analyze and discuss the multiple regression analysis assumptions, e.g., Linearity, Normality,
Homoscedasticity, and Independence using residual and other graphical/statistical measures and
tests for all models
8. Analyze and discuss any influential observations with recommendations, as well as the model’s
multicollinearity.

## Dataset:
The collected data consist of 100 observations on 7 different variables and is an example of segmentation
study for a business-to-business situation.
Each of these variables was measured on a graphic rating scale, where a ten‐centimeter line was drawn
between the endpoints, labeled "Poor" and "Excellent". Respondents indicated their perceptions by
making a mark anywhere on the line. The mark was then measured and the distance from zero (in
centimeters) was recorded. The result was a scale ranging from zero to ten, rounded to a single decimal
place. The seven HATCO attributes rated by each respondent are as follows:
# X1 -Delivery speed‐‐‐amount of time it takes to deliver the product once an order has been
confirmed
X2 - Price level‐‐‐perceived level of price charged by product suppliers
X3 - Price flexibility‐‐‐perceived willingness of HATCO representatives to negotiate price on all
types of purchases
X4 - Manufacturer's image‐‐‐overall image of the manufacturer/supplier
X5 – Service*‐‐‐overall level of service necessary for maintaining a satisfactory relationship
between supplier and purchaser
X6 - Salesforce's image‐‐‐overall image of the manufacturer's sales force
X7 - Product quality‐‐‐perceived level of quality of a particular product (e.g., performance or
yield)
