# Introduction:

HATCO (Hair, Anderson, and Tatham company) a large industrial supplier conducted survey of its customer through an established marketing firm and gathered a dataset. The survey
was focused on attributes identified by HATCO in past which is perceived to be the most influential in
the choice of suppliers.

# Problem Statement:

1. Understand whether these perceptions can be grouped. By grouping the perceptions, HATCO will
be able to see the big picture in terms of understanding its customers and what the customers think
about HATCO.
2. Reduce the 7 variables to smaller size so that other multivariate technique can be more
parsimonious.

# Dataset:

The collected data consist of 100 observations on 7 different variables and is an example of segmentation
study for a business-to-business situation.
Each of these variables was measured on a graphic rating scale, where a ten‐centimeter line was drawn
between the endpoints, labeled "Poor" and "Excellent". Respondents indicated their perceptions by
making a mark anywhere on the line. The mark was then measured and the distance from zero (in
centimeters) was recorded. The result was a scale ranging from zero to ten, rounded to a single decimal
place. The seven HATCO attributes rated by each respondent are as follows:

## X1 -Delivery speed‐‐‐amount of time it takes to deliver the product once an order has been confirmed
## X2 - Price level‐‐‐perceived level of price charged by product suppliers
## X3 - Price flexibility‐‐‐perceived willingness of HATCO representatives to negotiate price on all types of purchases
## X4 - Manufacturer's image‐‐‐overall image of the manufacturer/supplier
## X5 – Service‐‐‐overall level of service necessary for maintaining a satisfactory relationship between supplier and purchaser
## X6 - Salesforce's image‐‐‐overall image of the manufacturer's sales force
## X7 - Product quality‐‐‐perceived level of quality of a particular product (e.g., performance or yield)

* (It is to be noted that at the start of the analysis, we have total of 7 variables which were giving an overall
MSA of less than 0.5 which prompted us to delete the variable V5 from the dataset and then we achieved
satisfactory overall MSA to run factor analysis.)
